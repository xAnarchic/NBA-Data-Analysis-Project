# NBA-Data-Analysis-Project

Data analysis project on the NBA.

This project looks at previous NBA seasons and the current 2024-25 season to assess the current standings of the NBA. Statistical tests were performed using python and visualisations were created in Power Bi. From these visualisations, an analysis of this regular season was made.

Data used in this project was pulled from the following API: https://github.com/swar/nba_api.
